A parsed set of solo national winners setup for queries in Hive.

The data was pulled off of Appendix K of the 2018 SCCA Solo Rules.  I don't know if there are nay
licensing issues with using the data.  The document can be found on this page:

parser.rb was used to convert the raw text into csvs.  It is not very good.  The data is organized
according to the Hive default partition system.  It gives extra columns for category and class that
aren't in the actual data.

Queries are written using some Presto specific features for managing arrays.  Queries were run by
uploading the data to S3, creating an Athena table and copying the SQL into the Athena console.
Note that the bucket and base path have been removed from the create table sql.
